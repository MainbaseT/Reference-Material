# OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide Version 1.0

## 1. Scope

The “OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide” aims to outline certain requirements related to how an entity creates, delivers, and consumes Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), so that entities that produce and/or consume SBOMs that conform to this guide can ensure repeatability and streamlining of tools and processes for generating and consuming SBOMs. 

Note: that this guide does not require a conforming entity to adopt OpenChain (in any version) but doing so is greatly encouraged.

This guide is designed to work on a per SBOM level: an entity can use it as its sole way of delivering SBOMs but it is the individual SBOM that the guide refers to, not the entity that provides the SBOM. An SBOM using this guide can be called “OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide Compatible.”

Releasing SBOMs that match the requirements outlined in this guide does not preclude an entity from also delivering SBOMs for the same software in alternate ways or formats.
