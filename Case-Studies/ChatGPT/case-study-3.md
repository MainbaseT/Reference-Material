A case study about an automotive company facing open source license compliance challenges and how they improved their process management with OpenChain ISO 5230

# Body

Introduction:

Automotive companies often use open source software in their products to reduce costs and improve functionality. However, using open source software requires compliance with the license agreements, which can be complex and time-consuming. In this case study, we will look at an automotive company that faced open source license compliance challenges and how they improved their process management with OpenChain ISO 5230.

Background:

The automotive company in question was using open source software in their infotainment system. They had a dedicated team responsible for managing the software licenses and ensuring compliance with the open source license agreements. However, the team was facing several challenges:

1. Lack of a standardized process: The process for managing open source software licenses was not standardized, which led to inconsistencies in the way licenses were managed.

2. Difficulty in identifying and tracking open source software: The company was using multiple open source software components, and it was challenging to identify and track all of them.

3. Time-consuming manual processes: The team was manually reviewing license agreements and tracking open source software, which was time-consuming and prone to errors.

The company realized that they needed to improve their process management to ensure compliance with open source license agreements.

Solution:

The company decided to implement the OpenChain ISO 5230 standard to improve their process management. The OpenChain standard is a set of guidelines for open source compliance management that includes processes, policies, and tools.

The company started by creating a dedicated compliance team responsible for managing open source software licenses. The team included representatives from legal, engineering, and procurement departments. They were tasked with developing a standardized process for managing open source software licenses based on the OpenChain standard.

The team started by creating an inventory of all open source software components used in the infotainment system. They used automated tools to identify and track open source software, which reduced the time and effort required for manual tracking.

Next, the team developed a process for reviewing open source license agreements. They used a checklist based on the OpenChain standard to ensure that all license terms and conditions were reviewed and documented.

The team also developed a process for managing open source software components, including tracking changes, maintaining a record of contributors, and providing attribution in the software documentation.

The compliance team also developed a training program for engineers and other stakeholders to educate them on the importance of open source license compliance and the company's new process management.

Results:

The company's implementation of the OpenChain ISO 5230 standard significantly improved their process management for open source license compliance. The standardized process reduced inconsistencies in license management, and the automated tracking tools reduced manual effort and improved accuracy.

The company also improved their ability to identify and track open source software components, reducing the risk of using unlicensed software.

The new process management also improved collaboration between the legal, engineering, and procurement departments, reducing the time and effort required for license compliance management.

Conclusion:

Implementing the OpenChain ISO 5230 standard helped the automotive company improve their process management for open source license compliance. The standardized process, automated tracking tools, and training program improved license compliance accuracy, reduced manual effort, and improved collaboration between departments. The company's improved process management reduced the risk of using unlicensed open source software and helped them comply with open source license agreements.
