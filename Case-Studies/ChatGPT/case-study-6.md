# Title

A case study about a cloud company facing open source license compliance challenges and how they improved their process management with OpenChain ISO 5230.

# Body

**Background**

A cloud computing company had been using various open-source software components to develop its cloud platform. The company had always been compliant with open source licenses, but its compliance process was ad hoc, manual, and time-consuming. As the company's business grew, its use of open source software also increased, which made it challenging to manage open source license compliance.

**Challenge**

The company's legal team realized that their current compliance process was not efficient and that they needed a more effective and scalable solution. They wanted to standardize their compliance processes across the company, establish a clear policy for open-source licensing, and ensure that all employees understood their obligations under open-source licenses.

**Solution**

The company decided to adopt the OpenChain ISO 5230 standard to improve their open source license compliance process. The OpenChain ISO 5230 standard provides a set of guidelines for companies to follow to ensure that they are complying with open source licenses. The standard covers the entire supply chain, from software development to product delivery, and includes guidelines for documentation, training, and internal controls.

The company first established an OpenChain team to oversee the implementation of the standard. The team consisted of members from various departments, including legal, engineering, and compliance. The team's first task was to create an open-source license compliance policy that would cover all the software components used by the company.

The team then created a process for the approval of open-source software components. The process involved a review of the license terms and a determination of the license's compatibility with the company's proprietary software. The team also developed a training program for employees to ensure that they understood their obligations under open-source licenses.

**Results**

The implementation of OpenChain ISO 5230 allowed the company to establish a clear and standardized process for open source license compliance. The process ensured that all employees understood their obligations under open-source licenses, and the company's legal team had better visibility and control over the open-source software components used in their products.

The company's compliance team reported that the OpenChain ISO 5230 standard helped them reduce the time spent on compliance tasks by over 50%. The team was able to focus on more critical compliance issues, such as reviewing complex open-source licenses.

The company also reported that the adoption of the OpenChain ISO 5230 standard had a positive impact on their relationships with their customers. The company's customers were reassured that the company was following a standard compliance process and that they could rely on the company's products being compliant with open-source licenses.

**Conclusion**

The adoption of the OpenChain ISO 5230 standard allowed the cloud computing company to improve their open source license compliance process. The company was able to establish a clear and standardized process for compliance, which reduced the time and effort required for compliance tasks. The company's legal team had better visibility and control over the open-source software components used in their products, and the company's customers were reassured that their products were compliant with open-source licenses. The adoption of OpenChain ISO 5230 was a significant step forward for the company's compliance program, and it helped the company to achieve better compliance outcomes.
