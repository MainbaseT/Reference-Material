# The OpenChain Project

## For Managers

The OpenChain Project builds standards that are the foundation for open source license compliance and security assurance in the supply chain. This reduces bottlenecks and risk when using third-party code. Engagement and adoption is simple, free and supported by a vibrant community backed by leading multinationals across multiple sectors. 

OpenChain can be explained in five sentences.

1. The OpenChain Project makes open source license compliance and security assurance simple and consistent in the supply chain. 
2. OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 defines the key requirements of a quality open source license compliance program. 
3. OpenChain Security Assurance Specification defines the key requirements of a quality open source security assurance program. 
4. There is substantial reference and self-certification materials available on www.openchainproject.org.
5. The OpenChain standards make license compliance and security assurance more predictable, understandable and efficient for the open source supply chain.
