# Explainer for the Explainers
## What are they?
- Concise reference materials for OpenChain
- Short decks consisting of 4 or 5 slides, intended for different audiences within an organisation
- They are NOT legal advice and are intended to be adapted for each organisation
- They are intended to be very concise and straightforward. The OpenChain Project also has more in-depth material which can complement them
- We currently have 8 explainers in draft and ready for publication (excluding this one)
## Which ones do we have (as at 2024-10-16)? 
- C-Suite
- Legal Compliance Risk
- Procurement
- Developer Team Leader
- Developers
- HR Department
- Sales and Marketing
- Training
## Roadmap
- Explainers currently cover ISO/IEC 5230:2020 (Open Source License Compliance)
- The intention is to expand the range and to produce equivalent explainers for ISO 18974 (Security Assurance)
- We will be very grateful for any translations and localisations of the explainers to be added to the suite 
- Please let us have any suggestions for further explainer topics
